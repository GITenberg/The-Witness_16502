description: 'A powerful story of grace from the pen of Grace Livingston Hill. Star
  athlete, student, and fraternity president, Paul Courtland watches while a college
  classmate falls to an untimely death. Struck by his own part in the tragedy, he
  seeks solace in the classmate''s peaceful room-and in the faith he has discovered.
  A friend introduces him to a young woman who is certain to bring him out of his
  somber mood- and into trouble. After yet another tragedy, Paul must choose: to follow
  his emotions or his faith. Will his choice even matter to those around him?'
